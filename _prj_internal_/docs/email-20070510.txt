Hey Ondrej,

Nice, nice! Installed and using it!

Only tiny bit: start the numbering from 1, they're now out of sync
with the F keys.
As I see the code I guess you're in trouble with mapping the plain
number keys with the modifiers to the list items. I think a small
lookup table might help there.
That might allow to map "-", "=", "\" for 11, 12, 13 of course only
for english keyboard layout.

Paths shown in the list: might be that some hybrid solution is the way
to go. Because the full path will never fit that place for me and
filename only is too similar. I'm developing with Zope, there are lots
of similar filenames in different folders. And folders are deeeeeep.
Idea: let the options "just filename", "fullname" stay, add a "hybrid"
Where hybrid means:
 - until there are unique filenames display just the filename
 - at the moment two similat filenames would appear, start to display
  their non-similar parts, like:
  1 U:\zope_org\xzope\app\boston\__init__.py
  2 U:\zope_org\xzope\app\boston\browser\__init__.py
  3 U:\zope_org\xzope\app\broken\__init__.py
  ...
  8 U:\zope_org\xzope\app\boston\browser\__init__.py
  would display:
  1 boston\__init__.py
  2 boston\browser\__init__.py
  3 broken\__init__.py
  ...
  8 boston\browser\__init__.py
  (note that the debugger likes to open the very same file twice!)
  Not much better....

Another idea: (cut the crap option)
 Is it possible to put the "..." somehow at the from of the list
 items (instead of the end)? Like:
 "...on\browser\__init__.py"
 I guess exactly not, usually frameworks do this on their own so the
 only solution might be to do it in qwin, but how to have some idea
 how many characters to display?
 The Projects tab does it like "test_...ct.py" that's also not the
 best choice...

Good job, thanks a lot!
